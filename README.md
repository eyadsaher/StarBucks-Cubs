# Starbucks â˜•â˜•

## Project Description

The Starbucks website is a web application designed to showcase the Starbucks brand and I demonstrated my design skills and Javascript skills by allowing the user to click on the tiny cups below to change the design of the page to the cup choosen.

## The technologies used in the project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## JavaScript is utilized to add dynamic functionality to the website. Specifically, it enables the following interactions:

- Clicking on thumbnail images in the "tinyCups" section triggers image changes in the hero section.
- Hovering over navigation links and the "Learn More" button results in color changes.
- Background color adjustments and image transitions occur when interacting with thumbnail images.
- The JavaScript code is written in a structured and readable manner, enhancing the user experience.


Thank you for exploring the Starbucks website project. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to contact us. Enjoy your visit to the Starbucks virtual world!ðŸ‘‘
